In this Project, I have implemeted a Support Vector Machine(SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs .
Achieving an accuracy of 64%.
Tools & Libraries that were used are - Python , OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib.
The project included visualizing the classification performance with a confusion matrix , which highlighted the model's strengths and weaknesses.
